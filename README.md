## Overview

This action generates a coverage report for your Flutter project and deploys it to GitHub Pages.
It is designed to work with Pull Requests only. You'll need to run tests with coverage enabled to use this action.
It generates the coverage report using the `lcov` format and uses the `genhtml` tool to generate the HTML report.

Once deployed, the coverage report will be available at `https://<username>.github.io/<repository>/coverage/index.html`.

## Setup

You'll need to set up GitHub Pages in your repository to host the coverage report:
